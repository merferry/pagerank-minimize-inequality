The study highlights that inequality is prevalent in web graphs, and demonstrates that efforts to minimize it are more effective in contexts with high Gini coefficients. The choice of heuristics plays a crucial role in reducing inequality. Our research suggests that a combination of \textbf{edgeInsertCxrx} and \textbf{edgeInsertCxSx} heuristics may offer an effective approach to minimize inequality. Future research should continue to explore strategies to mitigate inequality in web ranking algorithms and promote a more equitable web environment.
